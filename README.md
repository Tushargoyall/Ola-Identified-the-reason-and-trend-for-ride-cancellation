# Ola-Identified-the-reason-and-trend-for-ride-cancellation
This project focuses on identifying the reasons and trends behind ride cancellations for Ola, leveraging various data analysis tools including Power BI, Excel, and MySQL. The goal is to gain insights into the factors contributing to ride cancellations and to visualize these insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

**Tools Used**

1.Power BI: Used to create dynamic and interactive dashboards to visualize the analyzed data, making it easier to identify patterns and trends.

2.Excel: Employed for initial data cleaning, preprocessing, and performing basic statistical analysis to prepare the data for deeper insights.

3.MySQL: Served as the database for storing and querying ride data efficiently, allowing for complex data manipulation and extraction.

# Project Steps

**Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**

Excel: Used Excel for data cleaning and preprocessing, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing data formats to ensure consistency and accuracy.

**Data Analysis**

MySQL: Performed SQL queries to extract and manipulate data, identifying key metrics such as cancellation rates, common reasons for cancellations, and time-based trends.
Excel: Conducted preliminary analysis to identify correlations and outliers in the data, which helped in forming hypotheses for deeper analysis.


**Data Visualization**

Power BI: Created an interactive dashboard in Power BI to visualize the analyzed data. The dashboard includes various charts and graphs that display:

1.Cancellation rates over time.

2.Common reasons for ride cancellations.

3.Customer and driver behavior patterns related to cancellations.

**Insights and Recommendations**

1.Cancellation Trends: Identified peak periods for ride cancellations, including specific times of day and days of the week with higher cancellation rates.

2.Reasons for Cancellations: Analyzed the most common reasons for ride cancellations, such as driver unavailability, long wait times, and customer no-shows.

3.Behavioral Patterns: Studied customer and driver behaviors to understand their impact on ride cancellations and provided recommendations to mitigate these issues.

**Conclusion**

The Ola Ride Cancellation Analysis project effectively combined the strengths of Power BI, Excel, and MySQL to transform raw ride data into valuable business insights. By leveraging these tools, the project provides a comprehensive understanding of ride cancellation trends and reasons, enabling Ola to implement data-driven strategies to reduce cancellations and improve customer satisfaction.
